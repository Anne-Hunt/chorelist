# Chorelist

This basic app allows users to create and alter a list of chores using React, Javascript, Vite, local storage, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome. It's available for viewing on Netlify and will soon be altered to allow users to sign in and view their chores. Future versions would also allow chores to be assigned to related user accounts.
